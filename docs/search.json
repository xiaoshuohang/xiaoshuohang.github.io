Test your knowledge belowüëá\n\n \n\nWith the curious spirit,let the exploration begin!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefination of marine species\n\n\n\nMarine life, sea life, or ocean life is the plants, animals, and other organisms that live in the saltwater of seas oceans, or the salty water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet.\n\n\n\nThis webpage mainly discuss about the peculiar and endangered species:\n\nPeculiar Species:Endangered Species:\n\n\nBeneath the waves of the Pacific Ocean lies the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast expanse of mineral riches waiting to be explored. A recent analysis by the journal ‚ÄúCurrent Biology‚Äù estimates that this underwater realm is home to around 5,000 sea animals unknown to science. Astonishingly, scientists know more about the mysteries of space than the secrets hidden in the depths of our oceans. According to research from Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, a staggering 91% of these marine animals remain undiscovered, underscoring the magnitude of the mysteries that still elude our understanding. The ocean, it seems, is a realm that rivals the enigma of the cosmos.‚Äù\n\n\nOnce seen as an infinite resource, the ocean now reveals a harsh truth ‚Äî many marine species are teetering on the edge of extinction. From the majestic whales to the playful dolphins, and the ancient sea turtles to the graceful seabirds, the populations of these creatures are dwindling at an alarming rate. ‚ÄòMore than 42,100 species are threatened with extinction, representing 28% of all assessed species,‚Äô warns the IUCN Red List. Among them, over 1,550 marine animals and plants are at risk, with climate change impacting 41% of threatened marine species. It‚Äôs a stark reality that demands our attention and action. As the numbers rise ‚Äî 150,388 species on the Red List, 42,108 facing extinction ‚Äî so does the urgency to protect our oceans and the incredible life they harbor. Let us stand together to ensure that these waters, once viewed as boundless, remain a thriving home for generations to come.(Marinebio,2023)\n\n\n\n\n1.
